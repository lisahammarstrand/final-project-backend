# Technico Bootcamp Final Project Backend

This is a project within Technigo frontend bootcamp, final sprint. The objective was to create an API with RESTful endpoints, using Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, and connect the endpoints to the frontend.

## How

I have focused on a few basic endpoints in order to set up a user flow with registration, sign in and profile information, and secure the data with crypto and bcrypt. I have used one single Mongoose model for this. Moving forward, I will create more endpoints to update and change user data, along with developing the frontend further.
